Hello, I'm Subaash Dumjhan from Nepal. 
I finished high school in my Homeland majoring on computer science. 
Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in IT at Ulsan College. 
I'm fascinated by IT because it driving progress not just in my country but worldwide.

I'm motivated to narrow the technology gap between Nepal and more advanced nations. 
While I sometimes envy the rapid progress in developed countries their citizens, it fuels my determination to evolve in Tech.

In this ever-changing field, I understand the importance of staying current. 
I'm fully committed to learning and excelling in this course to contribute to my own self growth as well as my Homeland (Nepal's) growth through technology.
