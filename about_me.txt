Hello, I'm Subaash Dumjhan from Nepal. 
I finished high school in my Homeland majojring on computer science. 
Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in IT at Ulsan College. 
I'm fascinated by IT because it drives progress not just in my country but worldwide.

I'm motivated to narrow the technology gap between Nepal and more advanced nations. 
While I sometimes envy the rapid progress in developed countries their citizens, it fuels my determination to make tech knowledge accessible to everyone around My Homeland too.

In this ever-changing field, I understand the importance of staying current in Technology. 
I'm fully committed to learning and excelling in this course to contribute to my own self growth as well as my Homemland (Nepal's) growth through technology.
